# NLP Spam Email Classification

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  
It demonstrates a full pipeline including data preprocessing, text cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and tuning.

##  Project Highlights
### **1. Text Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Removal of special characters using regex  
- Lowercasing  
- Stopword removal  
- Lemmatization (spaCy)  
- Tokenization  

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Neural Network  (96% accuracy)
- Logistic Regression (96% accuracy)
- Naive Bayes (93% accuracy)
- Random Forest  (97% accuracy) 
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)


## 📊 Feature Engineering
Techniques applied:
- Bag-of-Words (BoW)  
- TF-IDF
